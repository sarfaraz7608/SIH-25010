## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
```
A Smart Crop Advisory Platform designed as a multilingual mobile app and chatbot with voice support. The solution will provide farmers with personalized, real-time recommendations on crop selection, soil health, weather forecasts, fertilizer/pesticide use, and market prices.

How it addresses the problem:

1.Replaces guesswork with scientific decision-making.

2.Provides easy-to-understand insights in local languages with voice assistance.

3.Helps farmers adopt sustainable practices, reducing cost and improving yield.

Innovation & uniqueness:

1.Combines AI, NLP, and computer vision for pest detection and advisory.

2.Multilingual + voice-enabled platform tailored for low-literate users.

3.Real-time integration of weather, soil, and market data for precision farming.
```
## Technical Approach
```
Technologies to be used:

1.Mobile App (Android/iOS)

2.AI/ML for crop recommendation & disease detection

3.NLP for multilingual chatbot

4.Cloud & APIs for weather and market data

5.IoT/Soil sensors (optional for advanced use)

Implementation Process:

1.Collect soil, weather, and market datasets.

2.Develop AI/ML models for crop advisory and pest detection.

3.Build multilingual chatbot with voice integration.

4.Integrate APIs for real-time weather and market price updates.

5.Deploy as a mobile app with offline capability for rural users.1.
